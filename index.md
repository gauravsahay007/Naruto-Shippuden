                            <p>At first she may not look like much, but she is truly pure evil. Just to start it off she neglected her son all his life. Thats not bad compared to others on the list, but there is so much more.

She fused her son with a demon that constantly beats and insults Crona (her son). She told Crona to kill a baby dragon; when he refused he was shut in a pitch black room for months. Until he met Maka (the deuteragonist) he was not shown any compassion in his life. The only reason she had Crona was so that she could conduct experiments on him.

She has also killed dozens of people just cause she felt like it.

She has done some more bad things, but to grasp the level of evil of this “lady” you have to watch the show</p>
